# TennisTournament

This is a task project of a company that I applied for a position.

Add an input.json or use the existing input.json file in the StreamingAssets folder. The results will be calculated upon hitting Play button on editor and output.json file can be found in the StreamingAssets folder.

Open the project in a folder where the read and write permissions are not restricted.

The project was developed using Unity 2017.2 but feel free to open it with other versions since it is not version dependent.
